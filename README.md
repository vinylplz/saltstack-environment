# saltstack-environment
vagrant saltstack environment for testing formulas (e.g. jira-formula)

## Quick Start
1. Install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).  You need a 
relatively new version (i.e. probably not the one in your system package manger),
otherwise you will run into problems trying to add the vagrant box (below).
2. Install virtualbox

  ```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install vagrant virtualbox
  ```
  
3. Clone this repo

  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/vinylplz/saltstack-environment
  ```
  
4. Install formula dependancies like postgres and sun-java

  ```bash
  $ cd saltstack-environment
  saltstack-environment $ ./bin/install_formulas.sh

  saltstack-environment$
  ```

5. Install the chef/debian7.7 vagrant box if you don't have it already

  ```bash
  saltstack-environment$ vagrant box add chef/debian-7.7
  (...this can take a long time...)
  ```

6. Create the VM and install salt on it.  Doesn't apply any salt states.

  ```bash
  saltstack-environment$ vagrant up

  ```
  
7. log into the virtualbox VM created by vagrant

  ```bash
  vagrant ssh
  Linux packer-debian-7 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.2.63-2 x86_64

  vagrant@packer-debian-7:~$
  ```

8. run `salt-call`.  This is similar to `puppet apply` or `chef-client`

  ```bash
  vagrant@packer-debian-7:~$ sudo salt-call state.highstate
  [INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
  [INFO    ] Fetching file from saltenv 'base', ** done ** 'top.sls'

  [INFO    ] Syncing modules for environment 'base'
  [INFO    ] Loading cache from salt://_modules, for base)
  (...)
  ```
